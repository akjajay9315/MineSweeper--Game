This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Game Rules
This game features a grid-based puzzle where bombs are hidden at various locations. The goal is to reveal all non-bomb tiles without triggering a bomb.

How to Play:
-Bombs and Numbers: Each tile will either be blank or display a number. The number represents the count of bombs present in the surrounding 8 tiles.
-Example: If a tile shows the number 3, it indicates that there are 3 bombs in the neighboring tiles.
-Objective: Deduce where the bombs are located and reveal all tiles that do not contain bombs.
-Losing Condition: Clicking on a bomb will result in losing the game.
